## Blog
The Blog page has code to display any posts in the posts folder
```
 <ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul> 
``` 

## Posts
Put a markup file in the posts folder and name it in the format 
'yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`
Add some code to the start and it will then be listed as a `POST` on the `BLOG` page
Add this code to the header of the file to make it a POST 
``` 
---
layout: post
title: Shared Entry Point
--- 
```

If an excerpt marker is defined in the `\_config.yml` file then you can mark a section of the post as the excerpt. 
Everything above the  `<!—more—> `code will be the excerpt
```
<!--more--> 
```

Add this line the `_config.yml` to enable the excerpt marker
``` 
excerpt_separator: "<!--more-->" 
```
